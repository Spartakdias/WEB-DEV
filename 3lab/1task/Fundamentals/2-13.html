the answer: 1.
let i = 3;
while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}
Every loop iteration decreases i by 1. The check while(i) stops the loop when i = 0.
Hence, the steps of the loop form the following sequence (“loop unrolled”):
let i = 3;
alert(i--); // shows 3, decreases i to 2
alert(i--) // shows 2, decreases i to 1
alert(i--) // shows 1, decreases i to 0
// done, while(i) check stops the loop



From 1 to 4
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );
The first value is i = 1, because ++i first increments i and then returns the new value. So the first comparison is 1 < 5 and the alert shows 1.
Then follow 2, 3, 4… – the values show up one after another. The comparison always uses the incremented value, because ++ is before the variable.
Finally, i = 4 is incremented to 5, the comparison while(5 < 5) fails, and the loop stops. So 5 is not shown.

From 1 to 4
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );
The first value is i = 1, because ++i first increments i and then returns the new value. So the first comparison is 1 < 5 and the alert shows 1.
Then follow 2, 3, 4… – the values show up one after another. The comparison always uses the incremented value, because ++ is before the variable.
Finally, i = 4 is incremented to 5, the comparison while(5 < 5) fails, and the loop stops. So 5 is not shown.



The answer: from 0 to 4 in both cases.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
That can be easily deducted from the algorithm of for:

Execute once i = 0 before everything (begin).
Check the condition i < 5
If true – execute the loop body alert(i), and then i++
The increment i++ is separated from the condition check (2). That’s just another statement.

The value returned by the increment is not used here, so there’s no difference between i++ and ++i





for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      alert( i );
    }
  }



  let i = 0;
  while (i < 3) {
    alert( `number ${i}!` );
    i++;
  }



  let num;

do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);    



For each i in the interval {
    check if i has a divisor from 1..i
    if yes => the value is not a prime
    if no => the value is a prime, show it
  }
  The code using a label:
  
  let n = 10;
  
  nextPrime:
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // for each i...
  
    for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
      if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
    }
  
    alert( i ); // a prime
  }
